# Pentifall

The project, Pentifall, is my refreshing take on the classic block-dropping puzzle genre, paying homage to the beloved game, Tetris. However, it introduces a unique twist by utilising [Pentominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino), shapes formed by five square blocks, as opposed to the traditional [Tetrominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) made up of four. This change is inspired by the original puzzle games that were the foundation for Tetris, intending to present a heightened challenge due to the increased block size.

By leveraging the complexity of Pentominoes, Pentifall aims to captivate players with intricate puzzle-solving scenarios and push their strategic capabilities to the limit. It's designed to cater to those who appreciate the simplicity of the original game, yet crave a further test of their skill and adaptability.

Regarding copyright, while Tetris Holding, LLC does have certain rights, these specifically cover the aspects of Tetrominoes, the 10x20 board size, and also the distinct colouring patterns used for Tetrominoes. Pentifall carefully navigates these intellectual property rights. I use Pentominoes instead of Tetrominoes and the board size and block colours in my game are entirely distinct, ensuring no infringement occurs.

The visual representation of the game is an often-overlooked element of copyright law in games. In fact, courts have ruled in the past that visual aspects, including specific colour schemes, can be considered proprietary. With Pentifall, I've been conscientious in this regard, devising a unique aesthetic that separates it from Tetris while maintaining the captivating nature of the puzzle genre. For an example of how a judge has ruled on this matter, please refer to this article: [Defining Tetris: How Courts Judge Gaming Clones](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/defining-tetris-how-courts-judge-gaming-clones/)

<!-- Strategy - Competition -->
<details>
<summary><h4>Competition</h4></summary>

[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris): The timeless classic that started the falling block puzzle genre. Its simple mechanics, combined with its engaging gameplay, have made it a staple in the gaming world. It continues to appeal to a broad range of players, offering both casual and competitive gaming modes.

Strengths:

- Wide recognition: The game is a household name and synonymous with the falling-block puzzle genre.
- Simple yet addictive gameplay: Its mechanics are easy to understand but hard to master, which keeps players engaged.
- Multi-platform availability: It is available on almost all gaming platforms, allowing for a broad player base.

Weaknesses:

- Limited innovation: The game has largely remained the same since its inception, which might make some players seek more innovative alternatives.
- No multi-player: The classic version lacks real-time multiplayer capabilities, which are in high demand today.

[Tetr](Tetr.io): This is an online multiplayer version of Tetris. Its primary selling point is the ability to play against other players in real-time, offering both casual and competitive modes.

Strengths:

- Real-time multiplayer: It allows players to compete against each other in real-time, a feature that is not common in many Tetris-like games.
- Customisable experience: Players can adjust various game settings to their preference.

Weaknesses:

- Complexity: The various customisable settings may seem overwhelming to new or casual players.
- Less well-known: Compared to Tetris, it has lower brand recognition and popularity.

[Pentix (1986)](https://tetris.wiki/Pentix): Pentix is a variant of the classic Tetris game, developed and released in 1986. Like Tetris, it's a falling block puzzle game. The key distinction lies in its use of Pentominoes - geometric shapes composed of five square blocks - as opposed to Tetrominoes (four square blocks) used in classic Tetris. This increases the complexity of the gameplay and makes it more challenging for players. It was one of the first major adaptations of the Tetris concept.

Strengths:

- Unique mechanics: Utilising Pentominoes increases the complexity of the game, offering a new layer of challenge for players.
- Early innovator: Being an early variant of Tetris, it has historical significance in the evolution of falling block puzzle games.

Weaknesses:

- Dated graphics: As a game from 1986, the visual presentation can be considered outdated compared to modern games, potentially less appealing to younger audiences.
- Lower recognition: Despite its innovative gameplay, it's not as well-known as Tetris or other similar games, resulting in a smaller player base.
- Limited platforms: Being an older game, it might not be available on modern gaming platforms, limiting its accessibility.

I'm going with Press Start 2P for all of my text as it lends itself well to a game.

<h4>Colours</h4>

Drawing significant inspiration from the classic Game Boy, I was intrigued by the distinctive green screen. This design choice was made to ensure optimal visibility for black colors. Despite my extensive search, I was unable to find a precise hexadecimal color code for this unique shade of green. Nevertheless, I opted for #9bbc0f.

For accurately capturing the colors of the physical Game Boy, I used the [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) tool on an image of the [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy#/media/File:Game-Boy-FL.jpg). This approach provided me with a faithful representation of the console's iconic color palette.

<!-- BUGS -->
<details>
<summary><h2>Bugs</h2></summary>

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

1. Unitended game over state - You can move a pentomino to the side of the board before it's showing and 'hook' it on one of the edges.
2. Pentomino ghost consistency - Pentomino ghost is a lighter colour for 1 game step and then becomes the consistent colour that I've set.
3. Pentomino preview - Pentomino preview display blocks at different sizes, this should be standardised.
4. Text glitch - When the select button is pressed there is an odd text glitch on the start button text.
5. Cycling through menu items with keys or d-pad is cycling through hidden buttons.
6. Pressed a button on the gameOverScreen plays the game over sound.
7. Left and Right sound isn't played for each movement when keys are held down, or pressing in quick succession. This is also the case when rotating the pentomino quickly.

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

- [Start Menu not being hidden and Game Area not being displayed](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/125a448757b8a1ceef63196730fca4eaab73ae41) - Change _=_ to _-_ so that the const is using the proper variable name.
- [Start Menu would show again after briefly showing game area](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/4678ff341ab56b9206f82f4475b67a192d70e46a) - Remove the form tag, as I didn't actually need to input a form but just need the name input for validation and end screen.
- [gameCanvas wasn't being captured](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/e39423c6ca0fe2d5146b34156706f4b488ceba4d) - Change the ID captured from _gameCanvas_ to _board_, which was the ID on the HTML Canvas tag.
- [pentominoPosition variable couldn't be found](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/cde6eb663d54d0eb41c6e47893312ec54b1f8504) - Fixed spelling on variable.

- [Pentominoes weren't showing on the board](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/f456a3d27db121143a9ca8e85ece3dbb4bf954e0) - I gave the pentominoes a colour where the cells were being drawn.

I also added a boolean value to _movePentomino_ so that _gameStep_ knows whether the pentomino was moved successfully.
- [fastFallSpeed would only be active for a short time](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/c29af702834f145e26f9100ddcbd75de855fee21) - Add a _currentSpeed_ variable, along with a boolean to check if the _down key_ is pressed down or not. If it is pressed down then the _currentSpeed_ is changed to _fastFallSpeed_.

- [dropPentomino can be held down](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/cb7e26f26d6ae1f50805663bda1e0ff5f7f9a5ee) - This would cause frustrating gameplay, so I added a flag _isShiftKeyDown_.
- [404 error with sound icon images](https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms2-pentifall/commit/dcb93ddae181fe30d834af2ef2276d5ac34c0c35) - Removed `/` from the file path so that the images loaded correctly.
