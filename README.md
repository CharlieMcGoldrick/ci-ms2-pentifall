# Pentifall

The project, Pentifall, is my refreshing take on the classic block-dropping puzzle genre, paying homage to the beloved game, Tetris. However, it introduces a unique twist by utilising ![Pentominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino), shapes formed by five square blocks, as opposed to the traditional ![Tetrominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) made up of four. This change is inspired by the original puzzle games that were the foundation for Tetris, intending to present a heightened challenge due to the increased block size.

By leveraging the complexity of Pentominoes, Pentifall aims to captivate players with intricate puzzle-solving scenarios and push their strategic capabilities to the limit. It's designed to cater to those who appreciate the simplicity of the original game, yet crave a further test of their skill and adaptability.

Regarding copyright, while Tetris Holding, LLC does have certain rights, these specifically cover the aspects of Tetrominoes, the 10x20 board size, and also the distinct colouring patterns used for Tetrominoes. Pentifall carefully navigates these intellectual property rights. I use Pentominoes instead of Tetrominoes and the board size and block colours in my game are entirely distinct, ensuring no infringement occurs.

The visual representation of the game is an often-overlooked element of copyright law in games. In fact, courts have ruled in the past that visual aspects, including specific colour schemes, can be considered proprietary. With Pentifall, I've been conscientious in this regard, devising a unique aesthetic that separates it from Tetris while maintaining the captivating nature of the puzzle genre.

<summary><h4>Competition</h4></summary>

![Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris): The timeless classic that started the falling block puzzle genre. Its simple mechanics, combined with its engaging gameplay, have made it a staple in the gaming world. It continues to appeal to a broad range of players, offering both casual and competitive gaming modes. 

Strengths:
- Wide recognition: The game is a household name and synonymous with the falling-block puzzle genre.
- Simple yet addictive gameplay: Its mechanics are easy to understand but hard to master, which keeps players engaged.
- Multi-platform availability: It is available on almost all gaming platforms, allowing for a broad player base.

Weaknesses:
- Limited innovation: The game has largely remained the same since its inception, which might make some players seek more innovative alternatives.
- No multi-player: The classic version lacks real-time multiplayer capabilities, which are in high demand today.

![Tetr](Tetr.io): This is an online multiplayer version of Tetris. Its primary selling point is the ability to play against other players in real-time, offering both casual and competitive modes.

Strengths:
- Real-time multiplayer: It allows players to compete against each other in real-time, a feature that is not common in many Tetris-like games.
- Customisable experience: Players can adjust various game settings to their preference.

Weaknesses:
- Complexity: The various customisable settings may seem overwhelming to new or casual players.
- Less well-known: Compared to Tetris, it has lower brand recognition and popularity.

![Pentix (1986)](https://tetris.wiki/Pentix): Pentix is a variant of the classic Tetris game, developed and released in 1986. Like Tetris, it's a falling block puzzle game. The key distinction lies in its use of Pentominoes - geometric shapes composed of five square blocks - as opposed to Tetrominoes (four square blocks) used in classic Tetris. This increases the complexity of the gameplay and makes it more challenging for players. It was one of the first major adaptations of the Tetris concept.

Strengths:
- Unique mechanics: Utilising Pentominoes increases the complexity of the game, offering a new layer of challenge for players.
- Early innovator: Being an early variant of Tetris, it has historical significance in the evolution of falling block puzzle games.

Weaknesses:
- Dated graphics: As a game from 1986, the visual presentation can be considered outdated compared to modern games, potentially less appealing to younger audiences.
- Lower recognition: Despite its innovative gameplay, it's not as well-known as Tetris or other similar games, resulting in a smaller player base.
- Limited platforms: Being an older game, it might not be available on modern gaming platforms, limiting its accessibility.
